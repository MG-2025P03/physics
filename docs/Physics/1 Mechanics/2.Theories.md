# Range Analysis
Derive the range formula: $$R = \frac{v^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}$$.

Analyze the dependence on 𝜃:

Identify the optimal angle (45∘) for maximum range in ideal conditions.

Investigate how the range changes with variations in 𝑣 and 𝑔, observing proportional relationships.

Discuss edge cases, such as when 𝜃 = 0∘ (horizontal projection) or 90∘ (vertical projection).
