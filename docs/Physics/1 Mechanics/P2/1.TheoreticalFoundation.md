# Theoretical Foundations

The motion of a forced damped pendulum can be described by the differential equation:<br/>
[
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + 2\beta \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \sin(\theta) = \frac{F_0}{mL} \cos(\omega t)
]<br/><br/>
where:
<br/><br/>
(\theta) is the angular displacement,<br/>
(\beta) is the damping coefficient,<br/>
(\omega_0^2 = \frac{g}{L}) is the natural frequency of the pendulum,<br/>
(F_0) is the amplitude of the driving force,<br/>
(m) is the mass of the pendulum bob,<br/>
(L) is the length of the pendulum,<br/>
(\omega) is the driving frequency,<br/>
(t) is time.

Small-Angle Approximation
For small-angle oscillations, we can use the approximation (\sin(\theta) \approx \theta). This simplifies the equation to:<br/>
[
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + 2\beta \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \theta = \frac{F_0}{mL} \cos(\omega t)
]<br/>
This is a second-order linear non-homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients.
Solution of the Homogeneous Equation
The homogeneous part of the equation is:<br/>
[
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + 2\beta \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \theta = 0
]<br/>
The characteristic equation is:<br/>
[
r^2 + 2\beta r + \omega_0^2 = 0
]<br/>
Solving for (r), we find:<br/>
[
r = -\beta \pm \sqrt{\beta^2 - \omega_0^2}
]<br/>
Depending on the discriminant (\beta^2 - \omega_0^2), the system can be:

Overdamped ((\beta^2 > \omega_0^2)): Two distinct real roots leading to an exponential decay without oscillations.

Critically damped ((\beta^2 = \omega_0^2)): A repeated real root leading to the fastest decay without oscillations.

Underdamped ((\beta^2 < \omega_0^2)): Complex roots leading to oscillatory decay:<br/>
[
r = -\beta \pm i\sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \beta^2}
]<br/>
The solution is:<br/>
[
\theta_h(t) = e^{-\beta t}(A \cos(\omega_d t) + B \sin(\omega_d t))
]<br/>
where (\omega_d = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \beta^2}) is the damped natural frequency.


Particular Solution for the Forced System
To find a particular solution (\theta_p(t)), we assume a solution of the form:<br/>
[
\theta_p(t) = C \cos(\omega t) + D \sin(\omega t)
]<br/>
Substituting into the non-homogeneous equation and solving for constants (C) and (D), we obtain:<br/>
[
C = \frac{F_0/mL}{\sqrt{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2 + (2\beta \omega)^2}}
]<br/><br/>
[
D = -\frac{2\beta \omega C}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2}
]<br/>
The general solution is:<br/>
[
\theta(t) = \theta_h(t) + \theta_p(t)
]<br/><br/>
Resonance Conditions
Resonance occurs when the driving frequency (\omega) is close to the natural frequency of the system (\omega_0). At resonance ((\omega \approx \omega_0)), the amplitude of oscillations becomes significantly large because the system absorbs energy most efficiently from the driving force.
The implications for the system's energy are profound:

Increased Amplitude: The displacement amplitude increases, which means more energy is stored in the system as potential and kinetic energy.
Energy Transfer: The system can absorb more energy from the driving force, leading to increased oscillations.
Potential for Damage: In practical systems, excessive amplitudes due to resonance can lead to mechanical failure or structural damage.
