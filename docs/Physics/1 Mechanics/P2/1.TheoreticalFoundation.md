# Theoretical Foundations
The motion of a forced damped pendulum can be described by the differential equation:

$$\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + 2\beta \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \sin(\theta) = \frac{F_0}{mL} \cos(\omega t)
$$

where:

$(\theta)$ is the angular displacement,

$(\beta)$ is the damping coefficient,

$(\omega_0^2 = \frac{g}{L})$ is the natural frequency of the pendulum,

$(F_0)$ is the amplitude of the driving force,

$(m)$ is the mass of the pendulum bob,

$(L)$ is the length of the pendulum,

$(\omega)$ is the driving frequency,

$(t)$ is time.

### Small-Angle Approximation

For small-angle oscillations, we can use the approximation $(\sin(\theta) \approx \theta)$. This simplifies the equation to:

$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + 2\beta \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \theta = \frac{F_0}{mL} \cos(\omega t)
$$

This is a second-order linear non-homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients.

### Solution of the Homogeneous Equation

The homogeneous part of the equation is:

$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + 2\beta \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \theta = 0
$$

The characteristic equation is:

$$
r^2 + 2\beta r + \omega_0^2 = 0
$$

Solving for $(r)$, we find:


$$
[r = -\beta \pm \sqrt{\beta^2 - \omega_0^2}]
$$

Depending on the discriminant $(\beta^2 - \omega_0^2)$, the system can be:

Overdamped $((\beta^2 > \omega_0^2))$: Two distinct real roots leading to an exponential decay without oscillations.

Critically damped $((\beta^2 = \omega_0^2))$: A repeated real root leading to the fastest decay without oscillations.

Underdamped $((\beta^2 < \omega_0^2))$: Complex roots leading to oscillatory decay:

$$
r = -\beta \pm i\sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \beta^2}
$$

The solution is:

$$
\theta_h(t) = e^{-\beta t}(A \cos(\omega_d t) + B \sin(\omega_d t))
$$

where $(\omega_d = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \beta^2})$ is the damped natural frequency.

### Particular Solution for the Forced System

To find a particular solution $(\theta_p(t))$, we assume a solution of the form:

$$
\theta_p(t) = C \cos(\omega t) + D \sin(\omega t)
$$

Substituting into the non-homogeneous equation and solving for constants $(C)$ and $(D)$, we obtain:

$$
C = \frac{F_0/mL}{\sqrt{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2 + (2\beta \omega)^2}}
$$

$$
D = -\frac{2\beta \omega C}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2}
$$

The general solution is:

$$
\theta(t) = \theta_h(t) + \theta_p(t)
$$

### Resonance Conditions

Resonance occurs when the driving frequency $(\omega)$ is close to the natural frequency of the system $(\omega_0)$. At resonance $((\omega \approx \omega_0))$, the amplitude of oscillations becomes significantly large because the system absorbs energy most efficiently from the driving force.
The implications for the system's energy are profound:

<p align="justify">
Increased Amplitude: The displacement amplitude increases, which means more energy is stored in the system as potential and kinetic energy.
Energy Transfer: The system can absorb more energy from the driving force, leading to increased oscillations.
Potential for Damage: In practical systems, excessive amplitudes due to resonance can lead to mechanical failure or structural damage.
