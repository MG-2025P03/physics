# Implementation

[Simulate the motion of a forced damped pendulum](https://mg-2025p03.github.io/physics/Physics/1%20Mechanics/pPendulum.html)

Parameters: Set the gravitational constant g, pendulum length L, damping coefficient beta, driving force amplitude F0, and driving frequency omegaDrive.
Time Step and Simulation Loop: Define the time step dt and iterate over the total simulation time, updating the angular position (theta) and velocity (omega) at each step.
Data Collection: Collect data for both the phase diagram (continuous plot of theta vs. omega) and the Poincaré section (plot points at regular driving period intervals).
Plotting with Plotly: Use Plotly to visualize the phase diagram and the Poincaré section, which can illustrate transitions to chaotic behavior as parameters like F0 and omegaDrive are varied.

Experimentation
Experiment with different values for beta, F0, and omegaDrive to observe how the pendulum's motion transitions from regular (periodic) to chaotic behavior. Adjust these parameters to explore different dynamics and visualize the impact on the phase diagram and Poincaré section.
