Derive the equations of motion starting with Newton's second law: F = MA, accounting for gravitational force acting downward.

Use kinematic equations to find expressions for horizontal (𝑥) and vertical (𝑦) positions as functions of time.

Establish the general trajectory equation: y = x \tan(\theta) - frac{g x^2}{2(v \cos(\theta))^2}$$, 
  where 𝑔 is gravitational acceleration, 
      𝑣 is initial velocity, and 
      𝜃 is the angle of projection.
