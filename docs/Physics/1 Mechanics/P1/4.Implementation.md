When a projectile is launched with an initial velocity $( v_0 )$ at an angle $( \theta )$ from the horizontal, its motion can be described using the following equations:

Horizontal Range: $( R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} )$

Maximum Height: $( H = \frac{v_0^2 \sin^2(\theta)}{2g} )$

Time of Flight: $( T = \frac{2v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g} )$

Here, $( g )$ is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately $( 9.81 , \text{m/s}^2 )$ on Earth).

Range and Angle of Projection: The range $( R )$ is maximized when the angle of projection $( \theta )$ is $( 45^\circ )$, assuming no air resistance. This is because the function $( \sin(2\theta) )$ is maximized at $( 2\theta = 90^\circ )$.
