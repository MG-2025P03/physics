a. Distance traveled by a projectile, in both the vertical height and horizontal distance are directly impacted by the initial angle of the velocity.

- The higher the angle, the higher the vertical distance covered.
- The same parameter will also result with the projectile traveling a shorter distance.

b. Changing the initial velocity will have the following results:

- Increasing the initial velocity will result to greater distance covered both in vertical and horizontal distance.

- Decreasing the initial velocity will result to the projectile traveling a shorter distance in both height and range.
