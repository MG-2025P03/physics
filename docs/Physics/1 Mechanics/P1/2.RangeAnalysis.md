# Range Analysis

### Basic Physics of Projectile Motion

Equations of Motion: When a projectile is launched with an initial velocity 
$( v_0 ) at an angle ( \theta )$ 
from the horizontal, its motion can be described using the following equations:

<center>
Horizontal Range: $( R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} )$
</center>

<center>
Maximum Height: $( H = \frac{v_0^2 \sin^2(\theta)}{2g} )$
</center>

<center>
Time of Flight: $( T = \frac{2v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g} )$
</center>

Here, ( g ) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately $( 9.81 , \text{m/s}^2 )$ on Earth).

Range and Angle of Projection: The range $( R )$ is maximized when the angle of projection $( \theta ) is ( 45^\circ )$, assuming no air resistance. This is because the function $( \sin(2\theta) )$ is maximized at $( 2\theta = 90^\circ )$

### Optimal Angle for Maximum Range:
<p align="justify">
Theory: For a projectile launched on a flat surface (i.e., launch height = landing height), the optimal angle for maximum range is 45 degrees. This is because the horizontal and vertical components of the initial velocity are equal, maximizing the distance.
With Launch Height: If the launch height is above the landing height, the angle for maximum range is slightly less than 45 degrees, as the projectile benefits from additional time in the air.

### Symmetric Trajectories:
<p align="justify">
Description: When launched from and landing on the same height, the projectile's path is symmetric around the peak.
Angles: Two angles will yield the same range: </p>
<center>
$(\theta) and (90^\circ - \theta)$
</center>
<p align="justify">
For example, angles of 30 degrees and 60 degrees will result in the same range, but different times of flight and maximum heights.
</p>

### Time of Flight:
<p align="justify">
Dependency: Depends on the vertical component of the initial velocity and the height difference between launch and landing.
Calculation: For non-zero launch height, the time of flight can be found using kinematic equations that incorporate both the initial vertical velocity component and the effect of gravity.
</p>

### Maximum Height:
<p align="justify">
Calculation: Depends on the vertical component of the initial velocity and gravitational acceleration. For launch height (h), the maximum height (H) is given by:</p>
<center>
$[H = h + \frac{(vâ‚€ \sin \theta)^2}{2g}]$
</center>

### Effect of Air Resistance:
<p align="justify">
Real-World Consideration: Although not accounted for in basic projectile motion equations, air resistance can significantly affect the trajectory, reducing both range and height, and altering the optimal angle of projection.
