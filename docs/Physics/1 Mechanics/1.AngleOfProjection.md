The range of a projectile is a fundamental concept in physics, particularly in the study of projectile motion. It is influenced by the angle of projection, initial velocity, and the acceleration due to gravity. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis:
Basic Physics of Projectile Motion

Equations of Motion: When a projectile is launched with an initial velocity ( v_0 ) at an angle ( \theta ) from the horizontal, its motion can be described using the following equations:

Horizontal Range: ( R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} )
Maximum Height: ( H = \frac{v_0^2 \sin^2(\theta)}{2g} )
Time of Flight: ( T = \frac{2v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g} )

Here, ( g ) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately ( 9.81 , \text{m/s}^2 ) on Earth).

Range and Angle of Projection: The range ( R ) is maximized when the angle of projection ( \theta ) is ( 45^\circ ), assuming no air resistance. This is because the function ( \sin(2\theta) ) is maximized at ( 2\theta = 90^\circ ).
