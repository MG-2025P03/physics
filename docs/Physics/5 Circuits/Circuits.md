# Circuits with Graph Theory

## Graph Representation

Model the circuit as a graph where nodes represent junctions and edges represent resistors.
Each edge has a weight corresponding to the resistance value.

Identifying Series and Parallel Connections:

### Series Connection

Two nodes connected by a single path without splitting (i.e., no intermediate nodes are shared with other paths).

### Parallel Connection

Two nodes connected by multiple independent paths.

Reduction Process:

Start from a complex graph and iteratively reduce it by replacing series and parallel components with their equivalent resistance.
Use recursive traversal for nested combinations.

```
Graph edges with resistance values:
A -- B with resistance 5Ω
A -- C with resistance 2Ω
B -- C with resistance 10Ω
B -- E with resistance 4Ω
C -- D with resistance 15Ω
C -- E with resistance 3Ω
```

How the Algorithm Handles Nested Combinations

- Recursive Reduction: The algorithm inherently handles nested series and parallel combinations through the iterative reduction process.
- Graph Traversal: Each time a series or parallel pattern is identified and reduced, the graph shrinks and is easier to traverse.
- Convergence: By continuously reducing series and parallel components, the graph eventually simplifies to only two nodes connected by a single equivalent resistance.

This pseudocode outlines the approach for reducing the circuit graph step by step, handling both simple and complex configurations, including nested arrangements. It provides a robust framework for understanding how to algorithmically calculate equivalent resistances using graph theory.
For the advanced option involving actual implementation in a programming language, a suitable choice would be Python with libraries such as NetworkX for graph handling, allowing for practical testing of real-world circuit configurations.
