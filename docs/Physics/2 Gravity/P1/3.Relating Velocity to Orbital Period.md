# Relating Velocity to Orbital Period
The orbital velocity $v$ is related to the period $T$ by the circumference of the orbit:

$$
v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}
$$

Substituting for$v$:

$$
G \cdot M = \left(\frac{2\pi r}{T}\right)^2 \cdot r
$$

Solving for$T^2$:

$$
GM = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{T^2}
$$

$$
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} \cdot r^3
$$

This equation is known as Kepler's third law for circular orbits: $T^2 \propto r^3$.

## Implications in Astronomy

Calculating Planetary Masses:
By observing the orbital period and radius of a moon or satellite around a planet, astronomers can calculate the mass of the planet. This is particularly useful where direct measurement is difficult.

Determining Distances:
The relationship helps in determining the distance of celestial bodies. If the mass of the central body is known, and the orbital period can be measured, the orbital radius can be calculated.

Keplerâ€™s Laws:
This derivation is essentially a mathematical explanation of Kepler's third law. It tells us that, for a given central body (like the Sun), the ratio $T^2/r^3$ is constant for all orbiting bodies.

## Real-World Examples

Moon's Orbit around Earth:

By measuring the Moon's orbital period and radius, the Earth's mass can be estimated. This is a primary example of applying the derived relationship in practice.

## Planets in the Solar System

The relationship allows scientists to confirm that planets orbit faster when closer to the Sun, obeying $T^2 \propto r^3$.
Observations of Jupiter's moons, for instance, helped calculate Jupiter's mass through these principles, even before modern technology allowed us to visit the planet.

In summary, this relationship forms a crucial part of celestial mechanics and is fundamental to our understanding of orbital dynamics. It plays a vital role in the field of astronomy for calculating masses and distances, thereby enhancing our understanding of planetary systems, both in our Solar System and beyond.
