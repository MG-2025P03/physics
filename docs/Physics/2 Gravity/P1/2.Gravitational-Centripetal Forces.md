## Gravitational Force

The gravitational force is a force of attraction between two masses. It is expressed by Newton's law of universal gravitation:

$$
F = \frac{G \cdot M \cdot m}{r^2}
$$

Where:

$ G $: Gravitational Constant

- fundamental constant of nature that describes the strength of the gravitational force.
- Its approximate value is $6.674 \times 10^{-11}, {Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2$.

$ M $ and $ (m $: Masses

- The masses of the two objects experiencing the gravitational attraction.
- They could be any objects, like the Earth and the Moon, or the Earth and an apple.

$ r $: Distance

- The distance between the centers of the two masses.
- As the distance increases, the gravitational force decreases, following the inverse square law.

$ F $: Gravitational Force

- The magnitude of the force of attraction between the two masses.

## Centripetal Force

Centripetal force is the force that keeps an object moving in a circular path. It is directed towards the center of the circle.

$$
F = \frac{m \cdot v^2}{r}
$$

Where:

$ m $: Mass

- The mass of the object moving in the circular path.

$ v $: Velocity

- The tangential velocity of the object as it moves along the circular path.
- Higher velocity requires a greater centripetal force to maintain circular motion.

$ r $: Radius

- The radius of the circular path.

$ F $: Centripetal Force

- The required force to keep the object in circular motion, pointing towards the center of the circle.

Gravitational force acts between two masses and depends on their masses and the distance between them.
Centripetal force acts on an object moving in a circle and depends on its mass, velocity, and the radius of the circle.

In both cases, these forces arise from different contexts but are integral to understanding the motion of bodies under gravity, especially in celestial mechanics where both play significant roles in defining orbits and trajectories.
