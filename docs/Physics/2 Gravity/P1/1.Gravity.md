# Gravity

## Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

$$
F = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
$$

where:

$( F )$ is the gravitational force<br/>
$( G )$ is the gravitational constant<br/>
$( m_1 )$ and $( m_2 )$ are the masses of the two objects<br/>
$( r )$ is the distance between the centers of the two objects

Centripetal Force for Circular Orbit

The centripetal force needed to keep a body in circular motion is given by:

$$
F = \frac{m \cdot v^2}{r}
$$

where:

$( m )$ is the mass of the orbiting object<br/>
$( v )$ is the orbital velocity<br/>
$( r )$ is the orbital radius

Equating the Gravitational and Centripetal Forces

$$
\frac{G \cdot M \cdot m}{r^2} = \frac{m \cdot v^2}{r}
$$

Simplifying, we obtain:

$$
G \cdot M = v^2 \cdot r
$$
