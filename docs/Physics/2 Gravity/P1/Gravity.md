# Gravity

## Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

$$
F = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
$$

where:

$F$ is the gravitational force<br/>
$G$ is the gravitational constant<br/>
$m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects<br/>
$r$ is the distance between the centers of the two objects

Centripetal Force for Circular Orbit

The centripetal force needed to keep a body in circular motion is given by:

$$
F = \frac{m \cdot v^2}{r}
$$

where:

$m$ is the mass of the orbiting object<br/>
$v$ is the orbital velocity<br/>
$r$ is the orbital radius

Equating the Gravitational and Centripetal Forces

$$
\frac{G \cdot M \cdot m}{r^2} = \frac{m \cdot v^2}{r}
$$

Simplifying, we obtain:

$$
G \cdot M = v^2 \cdot r
$$

## Gravitational Force

The gravitational force is a force of attraction between two masses. It is expressed by Newton's law of universal gravitation:

$$
F = \frac{G \cdot M \cdot m}{r^2}
$$

Where:

$G$: Gravitational Constant

- fundamental constant of nature that describes the strength of the gravitational force.
- Its approximate value is$6.674 \times 10^{-11}, {Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2$.

$M$ and $m$: Masses

- The masses of the two objects experiencing the gravitational attraction.
- They could be any objects, like the Earth and the Moon, or the Earth and an apple.

$r$: Distance

- The distance between the centers of the two masses.
- As the distance increases, the gravitational force decreases, following the inverse square law.

$F$: Gravitational Force

- The magnitude of the force of attraction between the two masses.

## Centripetal Force

Centripetal force is the force that keeps an object moving in a circular path. It is directed towards the center of the circle.

$$
F = \frac{m \cdot v^2}{r}
$$

Where:

$m$: Mass

- The mass of the object moving in the circular path.

$v$: Velocity

- The tangential velocity of the object as it moves along the circular path.
- Higher velocity requires a greater centripetal force to maintain circular motion.

$r$: Radius

- The radius of the circular path.

$F$: Centripetal Force

- The required force to keep the object in circular motion, pointing towards the center of the circle.

Gravitational force acts between two masses and depends on their masses and the distance between them.
Centripetal force acts on an object moving in a circle and depends on its mass, velocity, and the radius of the circle.

In both cases, these forces arise from different contexts but are integral to understanding the motion of bodies under gravity, especially in celestial mechanics where both play significant roles in defining orbits and trajectories.

## Relating Velocity to Orbital Period
The orbital velocity $v$ is related to the period $T$ by the circumference of the orbit:

$$
v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}
$$

Substituting for$v$:

$$
G \cdot M = \left(\frac{2\pi r}{T}\right)^2 \cdot r
$$

Solving for$T^2$:

$$
GM = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{T^2}
$$

$$
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} \cdot r^3
$$

This equation is known as Kepler's third law for circular orbits: $T^2 \propto r^3$.

## Implications in Astronomy

Calculating Planetary Masses:
By observing the orbital period and radius of a moon or satellite around a planet, astronomers can calculate the mass of the planet. This is particularly useful where direct measurement is difficult.

Determining Distances:
The relationship helps in determining the distance of celestial bodies. If the mass of the central body is known, and the orbital period can be measured, the orbital radius can be calculated.

Keplerâ€™s Laws:
This derivation is essentially a mathematical explanation of Kepler's third law. It tells us that, for a given central body (like the Sun), the ratio $T^2/r^3$ is constant for all orbiting bodies.

## Real-World Examples

Moon's Orbit around Earth:

By measuring the Moon's orbital period and radius, the Earth's mass can be estimated. This is a primary example of applying the derived relationship in practice.

## Planets in the Solar System

The relationship allows scientists to confirm that planets orbit faster when closer to the Sun, obeying $T^2 \propto r^3$.
Observations of Jupiter's moons, for instance, helped calculate Jupiter's mass through these principles, even before modern technology allowed us to visit the planet.

In summary, this relationship forms a crucial part of celestial mechanics and is fundamental to our understanding of orbital dynamics. It plays a vital role in the field of astronomy for calculating masses and distances, thereby enhancing our understanding of planetary systems, both in our Solar System and beyond.
