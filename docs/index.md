# Introduction

This is the website for Meynard Gilhang's Physics activities.  This is my first time to use GitHub and i'm still grasping for the new scripting languages that are being presented as part of this solution.

I am a B.S. Computer Science in the Philippines and I've been a programmer since graduating.  I am your typical IT specialist with the following background:

  a) Multimedia developer (technology no longer available)
  b) Help authoring specialists (InstallShield)
  c) Web developer (Macromededia ColdFusion, Classic ASP and .Net (vba/c#))
  d) Data specialist (SQL Integration Services, and Reporting Services)

I am currently working as a Power Apps Developer processing remote tasks for a US company.
